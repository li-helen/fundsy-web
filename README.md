# Fundsy

_A personal budgeting app_

## Setup

```
npm install
npm run start-dev
```
Start by signing up as a user. Once you're logged in, navigate to "Account Settings" to link a bank account to your Fundsy account.

Click on the button that says "Open Link and connect your bank!". Click on "Continue", select any one of the listed banks, enter the following credentials (since we're in sandbox mode - do NOT enter your real account info here):

* Username: user_good
* Password: pass_good

Click "continue" one more time to navigate back to Fundsy.

Now, use the "Add a Category" button on the Account Settings page to create labels for your different categories of spending.

If you navigate back to "Home", you'll see all your uncategorized expenses. Each of these expenses has a dropdown that will show the categories you just created. 

Once you assign an expense to a category with this dropdown, you can see these expenses under "Expenses" in the nav bar, with a graph to show you how your spending has changed over time.
